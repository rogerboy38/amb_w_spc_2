3. **SPC Batch Record** - Statistical Process Control batch manufacturing records
4. **Deviation** - Comprehensive deviation management with CAPA tracking

### Child Table DocTypes

- **SPC Batch Parameter** - Quality parameters for batch records
- **SPC Batch Deviation** - Deviations linked to batch records
- **SPC Change Control** - Change controls applied during production
- **SPC Raw Material** - Raw materials traceability
- **SPC Equipment** - Equipment usage and calibration tracking

- **Data changes** - Old and new values captured for all modifications
- **System information** - IP address, computer name, browser information
- **Integrity checks** - Checksums and hash values for tamper detection

### Data Integrity (ALCOA+ Principles)
- **Attributable** - Clear user attribution with electronic signatures
- **Legible** - Human readable format with proper formatting
- **Contemporaneous** - Real-time data capture with accurate timestamps
- **Original** - Source data preservation with audit trail
- **Accurate** - Validation rules and data integrity checks
- **Complete** - Comprehensive data capture including metadata
- **Consistent** - Standardized data formats and validation
- **Enduring** - Permanent record retention with backup
- **Available** - Accessible throughout record lifecycle
